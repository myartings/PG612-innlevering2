Alpha 1 - for Poser 4 and Higher - (C) Sparkyworld.

--------------------
DESCRIPTION OF MODEL
--------------------
A highly detailed distressed sci-fi reactor control room.

Nearly all the parts are modelled not just textured, rusty pipes, computer and control panels, walkway and ladder. Also including a busted out wall with shattered bricks, so get ready to defend yourself against alien attack!  

Notes: 
This is my first attempt at modelling using Carrea 5 Pro, so the back of the model has very little detail. 
It was intended to be one part of a larger multi-part model, hence the medium-low textures. 
If you wish to make new higher res textures, just run it through your favourite mapper. 
The mapping is pretty logical in most places. Espcially for the smaller parts.
